Other treatments for eczema include azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, pimecrolimus, crisaborole, and tacrolimus, which are prescription creams and ointments that control inflammation and reduce immune system reactions. Calcineurin inhibitors, such as pimecrolimus and tacrolimus, are also recommended if OTC steroids don't work or cause problems. Corticosteroid creams, solutions, gels, foams, and ointments, made with hydrocortisone steroids, can quickly relieve itching and reduce inflammation.

It works by blocking an immune molecule called CTLA-4. Checkpoint inhibitors, also known as immune checkpoint blockade, are commonly used to treat melanoma. Interferon alfa (Intron A, Roferon-A) can be used after surgery to prevent melanoma recurrence. Targeted therapy of melanoma includes vemurafenib, cobimetinib, dabrafenib, and trametinib, which attack cells that have a damaged BRAF gene. Targeted medicines for melanoma with NRAS and C-KIT mutations may be available through clinical trials.",

It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 years of age. Cibinqo (abrocitinib) is an oral JAK1 inhibitor approved by the FDA for adults with refractory moderate to severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with other systemic drug products, including biologics, or when use of those therapies is inadvisable. Immunosuppressants are prescribed for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in children and adults to help stop the itch-scratch cycle of eczema, to allow the skin to heal and reduce the risk of skin infection. Topical calcineurin inhibitors, immunosuppressant tablets, and alitretinoin are some of the topical treatments for atopic dermatitis.",

Corticosteroid creams or ointments. Your healthcare provider may prescribe corticosteroid creams or ointments to reduce inflammation.

Topical treatment with tazarotene cream 0.1% applied twice daily for 16 weeks caused clinical improvement in seborrheic keratoses in 7 of 15 patients.

Dermatologists have been using cantharidin to treat warts and molluscum since the 1950s. When treating molluscum bumps, your dermatologist applies the beetle juice to each bump.
